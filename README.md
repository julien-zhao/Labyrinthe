# Maze Solver

## Description

Labyrinthe is a Java-based project developed as part of a third-year algorithm course. The project simulates a maze navigation game where the player must find their way from the start to the end. It implements algorithms to generate and solve mazes, providing an interesting challenge of pathfinding and algorithmic logic.

## Features

- Maze generation using different algorithms
- Pathfinding algorithm to solve generated mazes
- Java implementation

## Technologies Used

- Java
